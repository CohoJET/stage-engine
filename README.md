# Stage Engine
A multi-agent orchestration system that streams AI-powered improvisational storytelling sessions, initially based on the Fiasco tabletop RPG framework.

# Overview
Stage Engine coordinates multiple AI agents to collaboratively play through narrative-driven TTRPG scenarios. The system uses Microsoft's AutoGen for agent orchestration, Unity's UI Toolkit for visualization, and ElevenLabs API for voice generation.

# Project Status
This repository contains a sanitized snapshot of the core orchestration engine as a code example. Game-specific content (playbooks) has been excluded.
